Hi, I’m @SarKasM99 and I'm studying engineering at UCLouvain with computer science and mechanics as my options (INFO/MECA).

I will be using this github to post my university and personal projects. Those projects can be used by anyone as long as my credits are mentionned.

Feel free to contact me in case you have questions or requests!
